# React Typescript Boilerplate

This boilerplate using `react-app-rewired` helps to override `create-react-app` webpack config without running `eject`. Currently, it does:

- bind `react-hot-loader`.
- `styled-component` & its babel plugin
- support tailwindcss & its macros for styled-components
- support `bundle-analyzer` to analyze bundle size
